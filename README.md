# Diabetes-Prediction-Sysem
Diabetes prediction models use machine learning algorithms to classify diabetes.

These models include external factors that contribute to diabetes, such as age, BMI, glucose, and insulin. 

Machine learning classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree(D Tree) and Logistic Regression have shown the best accuracy for predicting diabetes early. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is a chronic disease that causes high blood sugar levels. Over time, this can lead to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
